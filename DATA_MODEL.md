In the provided code, the data model includes several data types and structures that are used to organize and manage information related to shows and shots. Here's an explanation of the chosen data types and structures:

1. Directories and Files: The code utilizes the concept of directories and files to organize and store data. Directories represent the main shows and subdirectories represent individual shots within a show. Files are used to store information in JSON format.

2. Strings: Strings are used to store various text-based data such as directory paths, directory names, file names, and character names. They are used to identify and locate specific directories and files within the file system.

3. Lists: Lists are used to store collections of subdirectories within a main directory. They are used to keep track of the created shows and shots.

4. Dictionaries (JSON Objects): Dictionaries are used to store structured data in JSON format. They are used to represent the description of a show and the information related to each shot. The keys within the dictionaries represent different attributes of the shows and shots, such as "Description," "Name," "Age," "Occupation," and "Abilities." The values associated with the keys contain the actual data for each attribute.

5. JSON Files: The JSON files are used to store the data for shows and shots. They follow a specific structure defined by dictionaries, where each file contains a JSON object with key-value pairs representing the attributes and values of a show or shot.

The chosen data types and structures provide a way to organize, store, and access information related to shows and shots. Directories and files provide a hierarchical structure for organizing the data, while strings, lists, and dictionaries facilitate the storage and retrieval of specific attributes and values associated with shows and shots. JSON files serve as a persistent storage medium for the data, allowing it to be read, updated, and deleted as needed.
